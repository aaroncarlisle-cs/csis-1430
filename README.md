CSIS 1430 - Internet and XHTML Fundamentals
======
This is a culmination of all my coursework from CSIS 1430 at Salt Lake Community College in May 2021. The course is intended to be an introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The page I've chosen to feature is my final project - a professional portfolio with links to all my other assignments for the class.
